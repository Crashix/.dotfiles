* My dotfiles
+ Operating System: NixOS
+ Shell: ??? /TODO zsh/
+ DM: lightdm + /TODO lightdm-gab-gradient/
+ WM: bspwm
+ Editor: ??? /TODO/
+ Terminal: urxvt
+ Launcher: rofi
+ GTK Theme: ??? /TODO/
+ Icon Theme: ??? /TODO/

Works on my machine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

* Quick start
Each application's dotfiles are kept in a folder of the same name. Each application's folder has the same tree structure as a user's $HOME directory, so to use my dotfiles for that application just copy them to the corresponding location in $HOME or create symlinks in the corresponding locations. If you have stow installed, you can do this simply with:

=make <application name>=

This will handle dependencies between my dotfiles. To use my default configuration, just run =make=. To use all my dotfiles, run =make all=.



* Nixos Management
+ make switch = nixos-rebuild switch
+ make upgrade = nix-channel --update && nixos-rebuild switch
+ make gc = nix-collect-garbage -d (use sudo to clear system profile)

*WIP*
